What is Anontune? Anontune is not another system of control, Anontune is freedom for music and all those who appreciate it. The Anontune project is an attempt to implement <a href="http://anontune.com/papers/Anontune_White_Paper_V2.pdf">an open platform for social music</a>. Openness here has the following meanings:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open for users means that anyone with access to Anontune will have simple, pain-free access to all of music.</li>
<li>Open for developers means that the project code is freedom and anyone is able to make changes.</li>
<li>Open for artists means having the freedom to earn money from their music without restricting the music's freedom.</li>
<li>Open for researchers means having access to data around music and social interaction to support scientific research and understanding of music.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<strong>The Anontune project hopes to achieve the following goals:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow open access to the platform and its information for developers, researchers, users, artists, and labels.</li>
<li>Provide legal indemnity and anonymity from prosecution for users.</li>
<li>Create a music engine for flexible, dynamic, redundant, and fault-tolerant organization of music networks.</li>
<li>Improve musical listening experiences.</li>
<li>Create a social environment and model for sharing and discovering music.</li>
<li>Support and contribute to experimentation and innovation around music.</li>
<li>Allow artists, labels, and associated parties to earn money from their content.</li>
</ul>
